		// Project Descriptions
		var kaplow1   = "I challenged myself to learn vanilla JavaScript with this project. I had originally started off learning jQuery, but I was far too curious about what was going on behind the scenes and took this as an opportunity to really learn some basic javascript. After many nights struggling over variables, writing random string and number generators, and typing 'document.getElementByID...' far too many times, I made Kaplow Quiz.",
			kaplow2   = "Kaplow Quiz was inspired by the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes! I had looked through a few quiz apps that others had made and noticed that they were often quizes about niche topics -- if you didn't know much about it, you were bound to fail. So I decided to try and even the playing field for all involved: the quiz randomly generates the answers to the questions and shows them to the player for four seconds. They then have 24 seconds to answer all of these questions.",
			meadow1   = "My first experience playing around with APIs! I was inspired to make this app when I found the sunset/sunrise API; I had been listening to a number of spooky story podcasts and reading a lot of short horror stories at the time. I wound up with some cascading API calls, as information from one was needed for the next, which was a rather interesting result. I used stock footage I found with creative commons licensing and edited the videos myself.",
			meadow2   = "A Calming Meadow, on the surface, is a very simple website. It shows images of fields and blades of tall grass blowing in the wind with only a prompt for your zip code. When you give this website your zipcode, it is then able to assign latitude and longitude coordinates to an api query to find out what time the sun sets in your zipcode. If the sun is still out, nothing changes. Come sundown, however, the app changes to a more menacing view and calls a current story from www.reddit.com/r/nosleep at random.",
			list1     = "Shopping List is a fairly straightforward project: I made this app as a way to give myself an introduction into Ruby on Rails. Understanding the MVC, routing, resources, migrations... it through me for a loop at first; by the end I had the swing of it, though, and had an app that creates dynamic pages, lists, and dependent child items.",
			list2     = "The hardest part of this project for me was learning about routing and making sure all of the pathing was correct. There were a number of errors that spanned the gamut from segments of code that were barking up the wrong tree to frustratingly minor spelling errors. It was a good experience and I learned quite a bit.",
			calendar1 = "This is my current project! I'm working on a calendar app for the Orbiter 3 theater company in Philadelphia. Their focus is on producing plays written by new local playwrights and I am super excited to help them with this app. I will have a few more details here when the project is finished!"
			calendar2 = " "
			// calendar1 = "Orbiter 3 is a theater production company in Philadelphia; one of the key members is a friend of mine who knew I love web development and they were looking to create a calendar app for their fundraising project -- a 365 day project where they try to get a sponser for each day to donate $3.65, $36.50, or $365.00. They wanted the ability for users to log in and claim a specific day to donate.",
			// calendar2 = "One of the big challenges was that they used Squarespace to create their website. The design was great, but as a service Squarespace doesn't play well with 3rd party features. To get around this problem, I cloned the design as best I could on my own and they were able to place the app under a subdomain (calendar.orbiter3.com), while hosting it through Heroku.";
